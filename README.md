This is the project where I chose to implement the paper "Constructing Bayesian Tangency Portfolios under Short-Selling Restrictions," published in Financial Research Letters in April 2024. The reason for this choice stems from feedback I received during a lab meeting when I asked my advisor about the limitations of Mean Variance Optimization in the Markowitz portfolio. Through that feedback, I learned about the corner solution problem and became interested in Bayesian approaches, such as the Black-Litterman model, which can address this issue.
